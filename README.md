### <center><u>Customer Banking</u>


#### Project description
In this project, I have created a customer banking system that allows users to calculate and track interest earned on Savings and Certificate of Deposits(CD) accounts. 

By running this application, users will be able to enter their savings and CD account information, see the interest earned, and view the updated balances after a specified number of months.

This program can be run through a platform that allows running of pythons scripts.
